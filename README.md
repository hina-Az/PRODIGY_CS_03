Password Complexity Checker
Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria 
such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and 
special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.


Here's a simple Python code for a Password Complexity Checker.
This code defines a function 'check_password_complexity' that takes a password as input and checks its complexity based on length, uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. 
The 'main' function gets user input for a password and prints the result of the complexity check.
